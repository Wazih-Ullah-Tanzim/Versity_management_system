                                            in society. Plato, in fact, had a very comprehensive scheme of education for his contemplated ideal state.
                                            He clearly understood that the philosopher king should have sufficient education to conduct the affairs of the state.
                                            In other civilizations also education was accorded an important place in their scheme of things, especially in their
                                            objective of attaining a good society. Kautilya in Athasastra and Khaldun in his Mukkadama have greatly emphasised the
                                            role of education in achieving ideal society.</p>

                                            bachelors and two-year masters degree in a limited numbers of subjects. They are Business Administration (from the year 2002),

                                            will be added. The University will eventually
